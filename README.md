* Next week plan(07/30/24): 
    * Lora training Qwen2 for [LMSYS](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lmsys-chatbot-arena)
        * Finetuning Gemma2 parameters, now get LB score of 0.937
        * Currently run out of Colab computation units
    * Training CNN model for [ISIC 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge)
        * Added CNN prediction as extra feature for LGBM and CatBoost for prediction -> LBï¼š0.177
        * Adding resnet, repvgg, and Xception would reduce LB score
    * training RepVGG model for [RSNA 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification/overview)
        * Completed -> LB scoreï¼š 0.58.
